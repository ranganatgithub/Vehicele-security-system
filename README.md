Disign and development of VSS


Problem statement :

The existing lock at the vehicle is not highly secured and can easily be broken, allowing anyone to steal the vehicle without the owner's knowledge.
The number of accidents and deaths due to accidents has risen sharply in recent years, with around 1.25 million people losing their lives every year due to car accidents, according to the World Health Organization.
In India, despite having only 1% of the world's roads, 16% of the world's road accidents are recorded on Indian roads, possibly due to an increase in the number of vehicles without a corresponding increase in road quality and facilities.
Unavailability of medical facilities at the right time and place is also a crucial factor in many accident-related deaths.

Automobile industry is adopting advanced technologies to provide user-friendly and advanced features to their customers.
Biometric recognition techniques, such as fingerprint technology, can be used to turn on the ignition and prevent unauthorized access to vehicles.
The GSM module can send an alert message with the current GPS location of the vehicle to the authorized person or owner of the vehicle if an unauthorized person tries to run the vehicle by giving their fingerprint or when they disconnect the sensor wires.
In case of accidents, the system can automatically communicate the location and details of the accident to registered emergency numbers.
